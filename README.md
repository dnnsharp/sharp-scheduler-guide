# What is Sharp Scheduler?

Sharp Scheduler is a time-based and application events-based task scheduler module for DNN.

It allows in an easy way to manage, schedule and execute actions such as: run SQL Queries, DNN jobs, executables, PowerShell scripts, Post Data, send emails and execute methods automatically and periodically at specific times/intervals (time triggers, interval triggers, cron triggers) or when an event occurs (on application start/end, at the beginning/end of every request)

Key Features:

Enterprise Focused
At DNN Sharp, we want pricing that is simple, straightforward, fair to the typical user and fosters adoption across your organization. Once you choose a Sharp Scheduler license, you have as many DNN installations as you want, at no additional cost. 

Extensions Framework
Sharp Scheduler allows you to extend it with new functionality and customize it to your own needs, just the way you like it by adding from a minor utility that performs a simple task, to a full blown application that performs many complex actions. 

DNN Schedule Migration
If you have specific tasks added to the DNN schedule, don’t worry, with Sharp Scheduler you’ll be able to migrate them.
