# What is Sharp Scheduler?

Sharp Scheduler is a time-based and application events-based task scheduler module for DNN.

It allows for an easy way to manage, schedule and execute actions such as: run SQL Queries, DNN jobs, executables, PowerShell scripts, Post Data, send emails and execute methods automatically and periodically at specific times/intervals (time triggers, interval triggers, cron triggers) or when an event occurs (on application start/end, at the beginning/end of every request).

### Key Features:

**Enterprise-Focused**

At DNN Sharp, we want pricing that is simple, straightforward, fair to the typical user and fosters adoption across your organization.

Sharp Scheduler can be extended and customized as per your own needs from a minor utility that carries a simple task to a full-blown application that performs many complex actions. 

**DNN Schedule Migration**

If you have specific tasks added to the DNN schedule, donâ€™t worry; with Sharp Scheduler you are able to migrate them.
