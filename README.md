# What is Sharp Scheduler?

Sharp Scheduler is a time-based and application events-based task scheduler module for DNN.

It allows in an easy way to manage, schedule and execute actions such as: run SQL Queries, DNN jobs, executables, PowerShell scripts, Post Data, send emails and execute methods automatically and periodically at specific times/intervals (time triggers, interval triggers, cron triggers) or when an event occurs (on application start/end, at the beginning/end of every request)
