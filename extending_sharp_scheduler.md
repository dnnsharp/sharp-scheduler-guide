# Extending Sharp Scheduler

Sharp Scheduler features an open configuration architecture where new functionality can be added just from the configuration files. This makes it a very powerful framework as well.

As part of the architecture weâ€™ve addressed a few hot topics that frameworks usually have:
Extensibility. Sharp Scheduler implements a decoupled interface where components (such as triggers, actions and trigger services) are created at runtime via reflection based on the XML configuration.
Continuous Updates. Custom components are not added directly to the main configuration file that comes with Sharp Scheduler.
