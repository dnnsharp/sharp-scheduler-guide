# Getting Started

This page guides you through setting up Sharp Scheduler. Let's say you want to send an e-mail once at a specified date and time.

Before you proceed, make sure you have Sharp Scheduler installed on your portal. You can download it from the Sharp Scheduler [download page](http://www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/modules/sharp-task-scheduler/download) and install it from Host > Extensions.

Create a page and add Sharp Scheduler as you normally would any other module, then locate and click the New Job button in order to create a new job.

Locate the Add New Trigger dropdown button and choose the One Time option from the Time category. Notice that there is no limit on how many triggers a job can have.

In this scenario, we want to send an email to a specific email address. In the Actions section, click the Add Action button, then select Email > Send Email.
