# App Events

The application events are those related to the Dot Net Nuke instance. While the http service (IIS) can have several DNN instances, a particular DNN instance has a unique Sharp Scheduler module, no matter how many portals it serves. Therefore, the Sharp Scheduler module is a per host module as opposed to per portal.

**The supported application events are:
**
* 
App Start 
Triggered when the current DNN instance starts ;
* 
App End
Triggered before the DNN instance is shutdown by IIS ;
* 
Begin Request 
Before a http request begins in the current DNN instance ;
* 
End Request 
After a http request ends in the current DNN instance

The App events can be added through the "Add new trigger" drop-down button (see screenshot below).
