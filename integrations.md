Search Boost Integration

Sharp Scheduler takes advantage of the Execute Method action to expose an interface for granular indexing of individual modules, folders and custom rules. This integration is available as a separate extension that you can download for free from either Sharp Scheduler or Search Boost download section. 

Once installed it places a configuration file under /DesktopModules/DnnSharp/SharpScheduler/Config/Actions/SearchBoost.config. Sharp Scheduler picks it up automatically. For more on how this kind of integration works, please read the section on Extensibility. 

One thing to always keep in mind about indexing content is how much time it takes and make sure not to schedule intensive operation to occur on a frequent interval. Where possible, optimize the indexer in Search Boost.
