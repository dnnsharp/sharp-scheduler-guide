Enable recent mode if you have issues with Gmail emails not being received by the trigger:
By default Gmail makes the email available to the first POP client that accesses the mail. So if you have another POP client that queries the account (Outlook, mobile device, etc.) and you have issues with our POP Mail trigger you can enable the recent mode by adding 'recent:' in front of the username. This will ensure that you receive the email from the last 30 days no matter what.
